Types of Objects
---------------------
1. Dependency object
2. Dependent object


1. Dependency object
---------------------------
-> This type of objects works independently.
-> They never dependent on any other class objects
-> Usually this type of object are top level class hierarcy 
	i.e -> may be data base class objects or any other service class objects

2. Dependent object
--------------------------
-> This type of objects, always depends on dependency object classes
-> Any changes on dependency will impact on dependent objects


Tightly couple approach
---------------------------
-> If a class dependents on other class, and because of dependency class
   changes, all the dependent classes get effected. This is tightly coupled
-> Extenson of application not possible in this type
Ex: Abstract classes

Loosely coupled
-------------------
-> All class objects are independently working together, then this is called 
   loosely coupled approach
-> Extension of an application is possible with this approach
Ex: interfaces
